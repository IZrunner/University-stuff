Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature 205
That we with wisest sorrow think on him 
Together with remembrance of ourselves. 
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, 
Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state, 
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, 210
With an auspicious, and a dropping eye, 
With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage, 
In equal scale weighing delight and dole, 
Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd 
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone 215
With this affair along. For all, our thanks. 
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, 
Holding a weak supposal of our worth, 
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death 
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, 220
Colleagued with this dream of his advantage, 
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message 
Importing the surrender of those lands 
Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
