Ronald James "Dio" Padavona was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to Italian-American parents 
from Cortland, New York. His family moved to Portsmouth from Cortland as part of his father's 
service in the U.S. Army during World War II and they resided there for only a short time before 
returning to Cortland. Padavona listened to a great deal of opera while growing up, and was influenced 
vocally by American tenor Mario Lanza. His first formal musical training began at age 5, learning 
to play the trumpet. Padavona participated in his high school's band program and was one of the 
youngest members selected to play in the school's official dance band. It was also 
during high school that Padavona formed his first rock-n-roll group, The Vegas Kings. He soon changed 
the name of his band to "Ronnie and the Rumblers" and shortly thereafter to "Ronnie and the Red Caps". 
Though Padavona began his rock-n-roll career on trumpet, he added singing to his skillset and also 
assumed bass guitar duties for the groups.

Padavona graduated from Cortland High School in 1960. He was allegedly offered a scholarship to 
the prestigious Juilliard School of Music but did not take up the offer due to his interest 
in rock music. Dio instead attended the University at Buffalo to major in pharmacology. 
He played trumpet in the university's concert band; however, he only attended the university 
from 1960 to 1961 and did not graduate.

Despite being known for his powerful singing voice, Padavona claimed to have never received any 
vocal training. He instead attributed his singing ability to the use of breathing techniques 
he learned while playing trumpet.
