1. Stand Up And Shout

It's the same old song
you gotta be somewhere at sometime
and they'll never let you fly
It's like broken glass
you get cut before you see it
so open up your eyes

You've got desire
so let it out
you've got the power
stand up and shout
shout, shout, stand up and shout

You got wings of steel
but they never really move you
you only seem to crawl
You've been nailed to the wheel
but never really turning
you know you've got to work it out

You've got desire
so let it out
you've got the power
stand up and shout
shout, shout, stand up and shout

Let it out

You are the strongest chain
and you're not just some reflection
so never hide again
You are the driver
you own the road
you are the fire -- go on, explode

Let it out

Stand up and shout


2. Holy Diver

Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me

Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean

Gotta get away
Holy Diver

Shiny diamonds
Like the eyes of a cat in the black and blue
Something is coming for you

Race for the morning
You can hide in the sun 'till you see the light
Oh we will pray it's all right

Gotta get away-get away

Between the velvet lies
There's a truth that's hard as steel
The vision never dies
Life's a never ending wheel

Holy Diver
You're the star of the masquerade
No need to look so afraid

Jump on the tiger
You can feel his heart but you know he's mean
Some light can never be seen

Holy Diver
You've been down too long in the midnight sea
Oh what's becoming of me

Ride the tiger
You can see his stripes but you know he's clean
Oh don't you see what I mean

Gotta get away
Holy Diver


3. Gypsy

Yeah gypsy

She was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'cause you were blinded by her light
She could crack your brain
With magic pain
And turn a paler shade of white

Well, I was on the free, just me and me
And just about to sail
When I heard the voice saying
You've got a choice
The hammer or the nail

You'll be ridin'
You'll be ridin' on the gypsy
I'm a gypsy

Well I rolled the bones
To see who'd own
My mind and what's within
And it's a given rule
That we're all fools
But need to have a little sin

So I'm ridin'
Well, I'm ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen

[Solo]

Well, she was straight from hell
But you never could tell
'cause you were blinded by her light
And so she cracked my brain
With magic pain
And turned my left around to right, right

So I'm ridin'
I'm still ridin',
Yes, I'm ridin' on, on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
She's mean


4. Caught In The Middle

Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know ooh ooh
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river in you flow

You can sail away to the sun
And let it burn you while it can

I walk along the bloody road
Like the hero who never ends

You'll feel it,
You'll feel it
You'll feel the rush of it all
Oh ooh oh oh oh oh

Flying away in the clouds
You're no more losing your control ooh
And finding your way in the dark
Like some poor forgotten soul

You'll feel it,
You'll see it,
You'll feel the rush of the city lights
I feel it,
I see it in your eyes

You're caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again

Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know ooh ooh
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river of nowhere send you flow

You can feel it
You can see it
You'll know the rush of thunder, yeah
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes

You're caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again

Like the rush of a thunder
That brings you under
There's some kind of spark
You're caught right there in the middle

You're caught in the middle
Caught in the middle again
All night long yeah hmm hmm hmm
You're feeling caught in the middle


5. Don't Talk To Strangers

Don't talk to strangers hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
Don't talk to strangers
'Cause they're only there to do you harm
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real

Don't hide in doorways
You may find the key that opens up your soul
Don't go to heaven
'Cause it's really only hell

Don't smell the flowers
They're an evil drug to make you lose your mind
Don't dream of women
'Cause they'll only bring you down

Hey, you, you know me
You can touch me. I'm real
I'm forever
The one that lets you look and see

Can you feel me?
I'm danger, I'm the stranger
And I, I'm darkness
I'm anger, I'm pain,
I'm the master
The evil song you sing inside your brain
Drive you insane
Don't talk
Don't let them inside your mind yeah
Run away, run away, go

No, no, don't let them in your mind or catch your soul

Don't dance in darkness
You may stumble and you're sure to fall
Don't write in starlight
'Cause the words may come out real

Don't talk to strangers (don't talk)
'Cause they're only there to make you sad
Don't dream of women
'Cause they'll only bring you down yeah

Run, run, run, run away


6. Straight Through The Heart

Hanging from the cobwebs in you mind
it looks like a long, long way to fall
No one ever told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it
I never heard it all

Living in a world of make believe
I can hide behind what's real
But wearing your emotions on your sleeve
and they all know what you feel

And here it comes again
straight through the heart
straight through the heart

Oh, never tell a secret
with your eyes
it's the eyes that let you down
Tell a little truth with many lies
it's the only way I've found
Oh, here it comes again
straight through the heart
straight through the heart

Shout to the wind
how can you hurt me this way
Oh, once it begins
it looks like it's coming to stay

[x2]
Hanging from the cobwebs in you mind
it looks like a long, long way to fall
No one ever told me life was kind
I guess I never heard it
I never heard it all

in the middle of the heart
No, don't stand still
they'll get you right through your heart
here it comes
here it comes again
straight through the heart


7. Invisible

If your circle stays unbroken
then you're a lucky man
'cause it never, never, never has for me
In the palace of the virgin
lies the chalice of the soul
and it's likely you might find the answer there

She had thirteen years of teenage tears
never a helping hand
She had fourteen more of rain before
she saw the sight of land
She was a photograph just ripped in half
a smile inside a frown
And then the light
the answer right inside her coming down
She said
I can go away I can leave here
I can be invisible
I'll go away

He was just eighteen and in between
a lady and a man
His daddy's girl in momma's world
that was when he ran
you know the word "confused" has been abused
but that's just what he was
And in the spark inside the dark
the answer came to call it said,

You can go away
you can leave here
you can be be be invisible

Well, I grew up quick and I felt the kick of life upon a stage
So I bought the book and took a fast look
at just the very last page
It was a single word that I'd just heard
from the two that came before
The only way to really stay
is to walk right out the door
So you can go away
I'm gonna leave here
I can be invisible and go away again
I can go away when I leave here
I can be invisible
I said when I've gone away
lord you know it's right to leave here
So I just became invisible
I went away,
I disappeared before your eyes.
You never touch me you never feel me
you'll never see me again
because I've just become unseen
Well I'm a photograph that's been torn in half
we're all eighteen and we're in between
We need a helping hand to the holy land
to be invisible
to go away


8. Rainbow In The Dark

When there's lightning
You know it always bring me down
'Cause it's free
And I see
That it's me who's lost and never found

I cry out for magic
I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold,
Lost my hold
To the shadows of the night

No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the dark

Do your demons,
Do they ever let you go?
When you've tried
Do they hide
Deep inside. Is it someone that you know?

You're just a picture
You're an image caught in time
We're a lie
You and I
We're words without a rhyme

There's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark yeah

[Solo]

When i see lightning
You know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free
And I see
That it's me who's lost and never found

Feel the magic
I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear
And you'll hear
It calling—you beware—look out

There's no sign of the morning coming
There's no sign of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow
Like a rainbow in the dark
Yeah yeah you're a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark
No sign of the morning
You're a rainbow in the dark whoa oh oh


9. Shame On The Night

Shame on the night
for places I've been and what I've seen
for giving me the strangest dreams
But you never let me know just what they mean
so oh oh so shame on the night alright
And shame on you

you've stolen the day
snatched it away
but I saw the sky and I never want to die
Now you know the reason why
I say oh shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
so I think I'd better run
Shame on the sun

for the light you sold
I've lost my hold
on the magic flame
but now I know your name

Oh lord just go the way you came
again oh oh oh
shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
so I know I'd better run

Shame on the night
for places I've been and what I've seen
for giving me the strangest dreams
You never never never know just what they mean
and oh oh so shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
here I go... I've got to run

Shame on the night
shame shame on you
Shame on the dream
shame on the sun and you
shame on the night

When I lost my hold
on the magic flame
but now I know your name

Shame on the night
shame on you
shame on all of you
shame on the night
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha


10. Evil Eyes (Alternate Version)

[2012 Deluxe Bonus Track]

Hide in the midnight
Turn out the lights, you'll see them anyway
Sail into never
They'll follow wherever you can go
And places that you never never know, no, no, uh

It's the call of the city
The way that black's pretty to the purest heart
There's places of pleasure
They promise you treasure if you fly
And then there goes the soul of you and I

Oh do you ever think about the way I caught the rainbow?
I'll be there where fire makes you dance
I'm going to give you the look that opens up the skies
I've got evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes

Yes, evil eyes
Ooh those eyes

Uh, hide in the night time
Turn out the lights, you see them anyway
Sail into never
They'll follow wherever you can go

Oh, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes, evil eyes
Evil eyes, evil eyes
Protect your lies, evil eyes
You're a thin disguise for what you are, your evil eyes, eyes

Sail into never
They'll follow forever
'Cause they're evil eyes ( eyes)
Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil, evil eyes, oh, they're evil eyes, just evil eyes....
